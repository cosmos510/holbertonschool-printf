.TH PRINTF 3 "March 2024" "Custom printf Function Implementation" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
printf \- format and print data

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B printf
function writes output to the standard output (stdout) according to a format string specified by
.I format
and any additional arguments.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, the
.B printf
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end the output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH CONVERSION CHARACTERS
.B The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.IP -b 
The unsigned int argument is converted to binary.

.IP -d,i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.IP -c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.


.IP -o,u,x,X
The unsigned int argument is converted to ( ) notation:

unsigned octal: (o).

unsigned decimal: (u).

unsigned hexadecimal: (x and X).

.SH EXAMPLE
The following example illustrates how to use the
.B printf
function in a C program:

.nf
.RS
\#include <stdio.h>
.br
\#include "main.h"
.br
int main(void) {
.br
    _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
.br
    _printf("The answer is %d.\n", 42);
.br
    return 0;
.br
}
.RE
